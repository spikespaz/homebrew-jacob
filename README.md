# Jacob's Homebrew Tap

A personal Homebrew tap for packages that I have needed. These are only tested on macOS Monterey.

Get [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) and tap this repository.

```console
foo@bar:~$ brew tap spikespaz/jacob
...
foo@bar:~$ brew install <formula|cask>
...
```

## Formulae

You're probably here looking for executables. Some of these are merely library dependencies for other packages.
